f2fw
progressive html/css framework

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

The f2 framework (f2fw) gives you a step ahead on your front-end development
by implementing the most important and common components of a web document,
while keeping an intuitive structure of the code that allows you to create
customizable layouts easily.

While I recommend you have the full version, you can build the framework
with a few nodes less, if you wish. You can choose between Base, Layout,
Columns, Typography, Navigation, Notifications, Debug.

It also comes built-in with a printer-friendly side and a responsive-ready
layout that is optimized for the iPhone or the iPad (and other touch-phones)

The custom builder is available at http://f2fw.com
