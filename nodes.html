			<h1>Base <sup><a href="http://f2fw.com/docs/base" title="Base">docs</a></sup></h1>
			<p class="p16">Base reduces cross-browsers inconsistencies by reseting HTML tags using an updated version of Eric Meyer Reset CSS<sup> (<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" title="Eric Meyer" target="_blank">1</a>)</sup> that also includes the new HTML5 tags.</p>
			<p>Base acts as a master reset and is automatically included with the framework. The new HTML5 tags added with the 0.1.7 release: <span class="tag">article, aside, canvas, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section, summary, time, mark, audio, video</span>.</p>

			<h1>Layout <sup><a href="http://f2fw.com/docs/layout" title="Layout">docs</a></sup></h1>
			<p class="p16">Layout is responsible with important components like logo, menu, buttons or with common used CSS classes, such as the ones related to float, margins, padding, borders, and so on.</p>
			<p>With the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind, the following common CSS classes have proven to be highly valuable and useful in web development:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Floats</strong>: floatleft, floatright, floatnone</li>
				<li><strong>Clearing</strong>: clearing, clearfix</li>
				<li><strong>Alignments</strong>: alignleft, alignright, aligncenter</li>
				<li><strong>Margins</strong>: marginauto, nomargintop, nomarginright, nomarginbottom, nomarginleft</li>
				<li><strong>Borders</strong>: noborder, nobordertop, noborderright, noborderbottom, noborderleft</li>
				<li><strong>Paddings</strong>: padding, nopadding, nopaddingtop, nopaddingright, nopaddingbottom, nopaddingleft</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>BIA: Buttons, icons and arrows</h4>
			<p>With a BIA class (btt, ico, arr), you can easily add buttons from external files, using the CSS Sprites technique, by only adding a width, height and a background position. Buttons already have the <strong>btt.png</strong> file applied, while icons and arrows have the <strong>ico.png</strong> and, respectively, the <strong>arr.png</strong> files.</p>

<pre>a.btt-login { width:50px; height:20px; background-position:-10px -10px; }
a.btt-login:hover { background-position:-10px -50px; }</pre>
<code>&lt;a href="#" title="#" class="btt btt-login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;</code>

			<p>A two column layout is composed from the main container, with a <strong>c2</strong> class applied, and its children containers with a <strong>c21</strong> and <strong>c22</strong> class. You can clear the floated inner childrens, either by adding a <strong>clearing</strong> class after closing the last children or add a new class, <strong>clearfix</strong>, along with the c2 class applied.</p>
